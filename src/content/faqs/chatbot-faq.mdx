  - question: "What kind of AI products do you offer?"
    answer: "We create custom-fit AI solutions based on each organization’s unique requirements, such as secondary sales and distributor performance analytics to track market reach and efficiency, tender analysis and match scoring to automate bid matching, and inventory and demand forecasting to optimize supply chain decisions and reduce stockouts. Refer to the use cases section for more details."
  - question: "How does it differ from our existing tools or subscriptions?"
    answer: "Our custom-fit AI solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing workflows, data sources, and KPIs, offering industry-specific designs for healthcare and pharma, domain-trained AI models for higher accuracy, and consolidated insights across sales, tender, and market data in a single dashboard. They also allow natural language queries for complex questions—such as identifying specific store performance patterns—and come with end-to-end support from deployment to ROI tracking."
  - question: "Which clients have you previously worked with?"
    answer: "We provide custom-fit AI solutions for every client, so no two projects are identical.

  - question: "We have our own in-house team, why should we consider your solutions?"
    answer: "Even with an in-house team, our custom-fit AI solutions can amplify their impact by automating repetitive tasks, delivering insights in minutes instead of days, improving accuracy through anomaly detection, and freeing your team to focus on higher-value strategic initiatives."

    answer: "Our solutions pricing is tailored to your organization’s scale, complexity, and requirements, with exact details provided after assessing your needs. We can provide you with the tailored costing post discussion."
